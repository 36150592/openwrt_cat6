Changelog for ez-ipupdate:

version 3.0.11b7 is a bug fix for the new ODS server update (it was
ez-ipupdate's bug).

version 3.0.11b6 has a small fix for dyns.cx changing their protocol by
accident (lower case Host now).

version 3.0.7 -> 3.0.11x I can't remember, check the changelog.

version 3.0.7 gives us a default max-interval for dyndns and allows specifying
intervals in days/weeks/months as well as support for another service
zoneedit.

version 3.0.3 brings a fix for hn.org that was causing it to ignore the
supplied IP address and always use the one that you were connecting from.

version 3.0.1 brings supoprt for hn.org and the option of using a pid file.

version 3.0.0 brings new symantics, now you MUST specify an interface and
service-type for daemon mode. it also brings many fixes, it seems that there
have been some serious bugs introduced some time after version 2.9.1 and this
should fix those and bring some new features like self throttling. All users
are strongly encoraged to upgrade to version 3.x.x.

version 2.9.3 brings long awaited support for a cache file. this was needed in
a big way for use with the dyndns.org service.

version 2.9.2 brings support for justlinux.com's new version 2.0 service, now
"justlinux" is for the justlinux v2.0 service and "pgpow" is for the justlinux
v1.0 service. now that penguinpowered has switched to their v2.0 update method
I don't know which one I like the best, probably dyndns.org.

version 2.9.0 adds support for EasyDNS. Their service is nice, very good web .
site design, it is commercial though thanks to Mark Jeftovic for the code to .
support EasyDNS                                                              .

version 2.8.0 adds support for GNUDip and TZO as well as a new feature to run.
a command after every successful update. There are probably some bug fixes in.
there too thanks to Jeremy Bopp for the code to support GNUDip and TZO       .

version 2.6.0 adds support for ODS and a couple minor fixups.

version 2.4.2 adds support for dyndns and some other cleanups. the service
that dyndns offers looks good, I still think I like justlinux better though.

version 2.2.2 gives us support for updating the MX record for dhs.org. I
have to say that the implementation of dhs.org's service is laughable. I
strongly advise people not to use it, it is just that bad. If you are updating
a dhs.org acount with an MX record then there is 60 second sleep() call (or
the length of the timeout, whichever is shorter) to get around problems with
dhs' service.

version 2.2.1 brings support for our friends at dhs.org and fixes a socket
leak in the dhs code and the penguinpowered code. I have to say though that I
am not impressed with the dhs.org service, penguinpowered.com gets my vote for
best implementation. (although they wont even acknowledge my client or put a
link to it on thier site)

If you are getting errors connecting to the server for a justlinux.com service
please ensure that you either specify "-S pgpow" or "--service penguinpowered"
on either the command line or in the config file(in the config file the syntax
is "service=penguinpowered"). The default for this tool is to think it is
connecting to an ez-ip.net service.

Version 2.0.0 brings support for other services than just ez-ip.net and
contains some bug fixes.

Version 1.0.1 brings some new features such the useage of config files,
timeouts on I/O, set user id and many more.

Version 0.9.0 fixes a problem with a leaky file descriptor and some other
litte things wrong. It also moves the version number up quite a bit as I have
been running it in daemon mode for over 60 days without any problems.

Version 0.0.3 fixes a bug in the user/password code and a bunch of issues with
the packaging (I copied another project to start this one and forgot to update
some stuff). I Also added the system type to the User-Agent string.

Version 0.0.2 adds some nice features for those of use who use Linux. It
now can run in daemon mode periodicly check the IP address of the specified
interface and only update it if it has changed. It also adds the feature to
turn your password in to '***' for the proccess listing.

switched symantics so that you now must specify either an interface or an

people banned, oops!). fixed the update code so that it is self throtlling
(should have done that from the get go, espesially since adding the not
updating properly in daemon mode bug).
