/**

 *
 * Most of the ZTAP SM and DIN connectors pins are directly controlled by the ZTAP FPGA.
 * All SM an DIN pins have a default behaviour as an input (interrupts) or an 
 * output (chip selects, clocks etc.). The default behaviour can be overridden by using 
 * the functions in this library. 
 *
 * Many (NOT ALL) FPGA pins are can be configured as inputs or outputs. See the ZTAP 
 * User's Guide Section 2.3.4 "Connector Definitions" for direction info.
 *
 * Pins that can be configured as outputs can be driven high or low.
 * Pins that can be configured as inputs are tri-stated.
 *
 * Example usage: Override ZTAP DIN connector PCLK signal to a low value instead of a
 *                square wave clock:
 *               
 *                PinControlSet(DIN_PCLK, PIN_CTRL_OUTPUT_LOW);
 *                PinControlEnable();
 * 
 * Applications that enable the pin control feature MUST also disable the feature if
 * the user expects the ZTAP to function properly after the application completes.
 *
 * The feature can be disabled from the ZTAP command line with the following:
 * 
 *    "pin override disable"
